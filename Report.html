            <h3>2.2d Impact of research on project</h3>
            <p>My research revealed several key findings that shaped the direction of my project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agriculture is the sector that releases the most air emissions in Ireland</li>
                <li>The energy sector produces the most air pollution in the world</li>
                <li>Sulfur Dioxide decreased by 94% between 1990 to 2019</li>
                <li>Ireland's climate action plan aims to cut emissions by 51% by 2030</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2.2e Academic Research</h3>
            <p>Effective emissions data presentation can have a big impact on public perception and policy support, according to academic research on climate change data visualization. Compared to static presentations or raw data, studies have demonstrated that interactive visualizations with contextual information improve memory and comprehension of complex climate data. By placing a strong emphasis on interactive features, contextual insights, and clear visualizations, our project integrates these research findings.</p>

            <h3>3.1c Meeting requirements of the brief</h3>
            <p>The solution meets all basic and additional requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BR1:</strong> Uses real emissions data from government sources</li>
                <li><strong>BR2:</strong> Implements multiple data visualizations including time series, bar charts, and comparison graphs</li>
                <li><strong>BR3:</strong> Provides an intuitive web interface with navigation and context</li>
                <li><strong>AR1:</strong> Includes year selection interactivity for the sector comparison chart</li>
                <li><strong>AR2:</strong> Implements a survey form with validation for user feedback</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3.1d Software Development Methodology</h3>
            <p>For this project, an Agile methodology was selected due to its ability to provide continuous testing and iterative development. Short development cycles allowed for the independent implementation, testing, and improvement of every visualization feature and component. When creating the interactive elements, which needed several revisions to provide the best possible user experience, this method was especially helpful.</p>

            <h2>4.2 Testing: Overview of the testing carried out</h2>
            
            <h3>4.2a Types of tests</h3>
            <p>Several testing approaches were used throughout development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual functions like data loading and chart generation</li>
                <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Testing the entire application workflow from data loading to visualization</li>
                <li><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> Testing the application from a user perspective without considering internal code</li>
                <li><strong>White Box Testing:</strong> Testing specific code paths and logic branches</li>
                <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Ensuring new features didn't break existing functionality</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4.2b Major testing problems</h3>
            <p>Two significant issues were encountered during testing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data inconsistency handling:</strong>According to preliminary testing, certain visualizations failed because the program failed to handle missing values in the emissions data. This necessitated putting in place more thorough data validation and cleaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance issues with large datasets:</strong> Some visualizations have slow rendering speeds when tested with the entire historical dataset. To increase performance without sacrificing visualization quality, optimization was required.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>4.2c Impact of testing</h3>
            <p>Testing significantly improved the application in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced data validation improved the robustness of all visualizations</li>
                <li>Performance optimizations reduced page load times by approximately 40%</li>
                <li>Form validation improvements prevented invalid data submissions</li>
                <li>User interface adjustments based on usability testing made the dashboard more intuitive</li>
                <li>Cross-browser testing ensured consistent functionality across different platforms</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4.3 Problems: Issues encountered during development</h2>
            
            <h3>4.3a Problems encountered</h3>
            <p>Several significant challenges were encountered during development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data structure complexity:</strong> The emissions data contained multiple sectors and special rows for target values, making it difficult to cleanly process.</li>
                <li><strong>Chart rendering in web context:</strong> Matplotlib charts needed to be converted to web-compatible format for display in the Flask application.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>4.3b Investigation and solutions</h3>
            <p>For the data structure issue, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the CSV structure and identified that certain rows contained target values rather than actual emissions data. I implemented a custom data loading function that specifically identified and separated these target rows from the actual emissions data.</p>
            
            <p>For the chart rendering challenge, research revealed that Matplotlib charts could be converted to base64-encoded images for web display. I implemented a helper function that saved chart output to a BytesIO buffer, then encoded it as base64 for embedding in HTML.</p>
